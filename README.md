"# AutoTestX" 
An AI-driven automated testing agent built with Langchain that converts user-uploaded requirement PDFs into structured
JSON, auto-generates XPath selectors from live URLs, creates test cases based on extracted business logic, and writes Selenium scripts for automated
execution â€” powered by a backend stack of Express (Node.js) and Python Flask for seamless coordination.
